# [First Impressions ðŸ’€](https://rohinsood.github.io/first-impressions/index.html): An interactive guide to chess openings

Click the openings in the Nav Bar to change the opening &&
Click the buttons below the chessboard to show the moves of the chosen opening

### Known bugs
 - Switching to an opening from a move numebr greater than the maximum number of moves of the opening chosen crashes the site (L) 
      Reload to fix (TODO: Lift the Movenum state up to the navbar and set to 0 OnClick)
